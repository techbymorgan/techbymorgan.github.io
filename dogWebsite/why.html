            <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats</h2>
            <article>
                <p>In my opinion dogs are more playful and have more character to them. I would love to have a dog so I will never feel alone because cats are more calm and don't really do anything. Dogs are way more energetic which is what I am like and I will never get bored or get tired of taking care of it.</p>
